Overall, the code creates a basic web page for a fictional small business, with a header, main content, and footer. The page includes a navigation menu with a link to a contact page and a description of the services offered by the business.


**contact.html file.....**
  This code is an HTML page for a contact form for a fictional small business. The form includes fields for the user's name, email, subject, and message. The form has been created with required fields and a submit button to submit the form. The code also includes a JavaScript file, "form-validation.js", that provides form validation, which ensures that all required fields are filled out before the form is submitted. A message element with an ID of "formMessage" is also included to display any form validation error messages. The page includes a header, main section, and footer. The header includes the company name and the main section includes the form and a button that links back to the home page. The footer includes a copyright notice.
  
  
 **style.css file.....**
 CSS code that styles the HTML elements for a webpage.

**form-validation.js file.....**
The above code is a JavaScript function to validate the form data that is submitted on a contact form. The function first prevents the default form submission behavior by calling event.preventDefault().Then, the function retrieves the values of the form fields for name, email, subject and message. If any of the fields are empty, an alert message is displayed with the message "All fields are required". If the email address does not contain the "@" symbol, an alert message is displayed with the message "Invalid email address".If all of the fields have values, an alert message is displayed with the contents of the form fields. The function then sets the inner HTML of an element with an ID of "formMessage" to the message "Message successfully submitted!". Finally, the function returns true to indicate that the form validation has passed.


**Challenges faced.....**
In the javascript file few little complexities regarding validations were faced
